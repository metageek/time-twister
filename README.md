# time-twister
Time Twister is a game for Pico-8. In the game, the player is being
chased by robots. The player can move orthogonally, or teleport. When
they teleport, they sort of go back in time: a ghost appears and
enacts the moves the player made up until the teleport. Each robot
chases the nearest player (either the real player or a ghost).

Time Twister was written by John Stracke. It was inspired by a
Macintosh game, circa 1987, called Daleks; Daleks was similar, except
for the time travel part. Daleks seemed like it was inspired by the
game Chase, in _More Basic Computer Games_, published by David H. Ahl
in 1979. Time Twister is copyright â“’ 2025 John Stracke, licensed under
